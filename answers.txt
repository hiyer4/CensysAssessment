Part 1 (research)

        The name of the software that is installed and running on the IP {114.119.117.220} http service is Nginx. I identified
        this by looking at the services.software.product value in the Host Summary Censys report. I was also able to verfiy the 
        software by doing a quick TCP port scan of the IP address using nmap as well as using enumeration tools with a C2 framework
        (Metasploit). 

        The version of the Nginx software is not identified by the censys report as there is no services.software.version tab
        as seen with other Nginx hosts. Moreover the CPE (common platform enumeration) value is shown by services.software.uniform_resource_identifier
        as cpe:2.3:a:nginx:nginx:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*. This specific cpe has the wildcard asterisk character (*) for the version component, which means 
        that the version is unidentified. 


Part 2 (development)

        The README.md file shows how to run the nginxenumerator.py and obtain the version count/info for nginx hosts. The script obtains the CPE for each 
        host that is running Nginx software and outputs a count of the number of servers running that specific nginx version.


Part 3 (light analysis)

        The README.md file shows how to run the lightanalysis.py and obtain general information on the number of nginx servers running HTTP or HTTPs 
        as well as the different ports running the software.
